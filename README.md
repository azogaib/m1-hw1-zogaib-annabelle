I ran into quite a few issues completing this assignment, the first being my terminal. After adding an SSH key, the colors on my terminal disappeared. After a lot of googling, I found that I needed to revert my terminal to bash commands. The next issue I ran into was working in a new branch. I used the command "checkout" but was met with error messages stating that I was not working in any branch. Although I'm not sure how that happened in the first place, I believe I'd be able to smoothly create a branch, commit something, and then merge with main if I attempted to do it again. 

I mostly used github's FAQ and tutorial section to answer my questions, while also googling the error messages I'd receive. I also had some command line PDFs I referred to.

These issues took me longer than I'd like to admit to figure out. I didn't take a coding class of the summer so I am pretty rusty. I hope the next assigmnets go smoother.
